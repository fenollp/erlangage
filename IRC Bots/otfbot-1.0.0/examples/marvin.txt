Life? Don't talk to me about life.
Life, loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it.
And then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side.
Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they get me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't.
Oh god, I'm so depressed.
